# SubjetProducer
The SubjetProducer producer creates value maps for basic subjet variables for a given jet collection.

## Important notes
The following limitations exist but could easily eliminated if I get the impulse to develop:

* This only works for CA12 jets.
* This only gets the subjets for the first two leading jets.
